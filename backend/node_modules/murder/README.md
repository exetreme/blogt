# MURDER README

A murder is a group of highly intelligent birds that are known to visually recognize humans. They will transmit information about humans by squawking.

Murder is based mainly on Swarm. I wanted an easier API, and better documentation. I also wanted the code to be much simpler than Swarm, like the crdt npm module. I also wanted state changes to acknowledge that they've been distributed with promises.

>  NOTE: Existing source adapters are implemented against node modules that
>  are written in pure JavaScript so that they do not require a compile step.
>  This was done to make murder more portable. It is easy to write custom
>  source adapters that use modules which depend on compiled extensions.

# Docs

API methods are specified in the documentation in two ways:
1. `Object.method()` -- Describes a class level method or a module method.
2. `Object:method()` -- Describes a method on the prototype of the `Object`. This is a shorthand for `Object.prototype.method()` in the documentation.

```javascript
var myDocument = new Model('id', 'author', [localStorage, remoteSource]);
myDocument.sync().then(function () {
  myDocument.change({key: 'value'}).then(function () {
    console.log('done');
  });
});
```

This project is designed to run on a Tessel. In order to meet this requirement no compiled dependencies are used.
